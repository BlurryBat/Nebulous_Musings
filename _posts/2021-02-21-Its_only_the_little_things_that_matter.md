## Little things are true happiness.

I always wanted to become someone big. Someone whom everyone would aspire to be.
I wanted to be a global sensation. But lately as I just see myself being a mediocre guy, 
working for a big corporation in my mid 20s, thinking where it went wrong. Let alone being a Ronaldo or a Messi of my field 
I dont even have the passion or drive to complete something that I start.

The problem was I never started. I either dreamt too big for my cup, or discarded all the silly ideas I ever had thinking
every minute spent on a small idea is a minute denied for my big dreams. But the thing is
you dont become big for the sake of becoming big, you become big when your passion happens to be what people like to follow.
Always stick to your passion and the things that you are [willing to work hard for](http://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/blog/archives/monthly/2018-10.html#e2018-10-21T09_53_29.htm).

I want to do it all over again, and this time I want to do it for me.
