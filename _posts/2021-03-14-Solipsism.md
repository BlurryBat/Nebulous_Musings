I came across a video by Mystiverse about [Boltzmann Brain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwcth3CR5c) and Its got me thinking.
Its about using thermodynamics to prove how our existence is such a low probability.
But then its a survivorship bias, I guess, because all the states we dont exist we dont measure.

Our whole life, we do things looking at others and strive to live the parts we envy.
Why are we doing what we are doing ? is there really free will. There are so many questions, 
and Iam not even sure if we will ever find an answer to these.

The general feeling of this world is segregating the successful and failed people. 
And making everyone strive for success. But what determines success ?
I guess its something that is hard to have, but then the people who have it are really lucky to have it.
Yet they are entitled to it.

Does there really exist a free will? if not then can a non freewill system know it doesnt have a free will ?
I think thought experiments on the concept of free wills, not existing could be something.
