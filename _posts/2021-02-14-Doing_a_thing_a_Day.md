title: Doing a thing a Day
---

Life is pretty short, and there is only so much you can do before you're gone.
If you are someone who wants to have accomplished something before your time is up, procrastination and distractions are your biggest enemies.
With the current world moving so fast and information and ideas being bombarded at you at such a rapid pace, it can be easy to lose track of what you really want to be doing.
You may be filling out your obligation or taking a quick side tour in life... itâ€™s totally fine to experience what life has to offer you but you should not lose track of what you really want to accomplish.
If you are one of the lucky ones who is here just for the flow and are completely happy exploring and finding out new things, then this post probably doesn't really hold true for you.
But if you are one of those folks who cannot get sleep at times when your friends are accomplishing all their goals maybe progressing in their career, setting up their business... and you are too busy getting distracted,
maybe this post is relevant for you.

Okay so the idea is just to track 1 activity that you want to be doing on a particular day. As you wake up you start a stopwatch, which will run for the rest of your day except when you are doing what you want to be doing. 
Imagine its basketball practice. You wake up , start the timer and go about your daily chores and when it's basketball time you just pause the timer and when you stop for a break you let the timer run.
So It's like how clocks would work in a chess game... sort of. When you are not doing it maybe you are thinking about it ? and you get a time penalty for thinking about it and not making the move.
You stop the clock when you are about to go to bed and you record the time on the stopwatch.
This way you can keep track of how much time in the day that you could have spent on your thing but didn't. Okay I understand that you need time off for lunch and dinner and stuff but... you get the point.
And the days when all you want to be doing is what you are doing, maybe when you are on a vacation, then you can record 0 for the day.

So basically by keeping track of the time on your daily clock you grow conscious of the time you are spending not doing what you want to be doing.

You can think of it as the fees you are paying for distractions.
