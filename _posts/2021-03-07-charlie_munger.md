title: Quotes by Charlie Munger
---

Most of my thoughts this week revolved around what something charlie munger said to buffet.
I dont remember the whole context but he said something like you will understand because you are smart.
Well, I've been spending time trying to understand things, I am not really striving to create a brilliance, I am just
enjoying others brilliance.

So for this week I will be just quoting some quotes from Munger I found interesting.

* Simplicity has a way of improving performance by enabling us to better understand what we are doing.
* We both (Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett) insist on a lot of time being available almost every day to just sit and think. That is very uncommon in American business. We read and think.
* I constantly see people rise in life who are not the smartest, sometimes not even the most diligent, but they are learning machines. They go to bed every night a little wiser than they were when they got up and boy does that help, particularly when you have a long run ahead of you.
* Develop into a lifelong self-learner through voracious reading; cultivate curiosity and strive to become a little wiser every day.
* Take a simple idea and take it seriously.
* You don’t have to be brilliant, only a little it wiser than the other guys, on average, for a long time.
* Assume life will be really tough, and then ask if you can handle  it. If the answer is yes, you’ve won.
* If your new behavior gives you a little temporary unpopularity with your peer group, then to hell with them.
* No wise pilot, no matter how great his talent and experience, fails to use a checklist.
* There is no way you can live an adequate life without making many mistakes.
