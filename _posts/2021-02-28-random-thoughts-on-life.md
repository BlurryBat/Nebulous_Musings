title: Random Thoughts on Life.
---

Its funny how any of the annoyances a year back doesn't bother you anymore, time truely does heal people. Time is the only way people can move on from the problems 
they cant solve.

But time sadly isnt unlimited. There is going to be one day when you know its your time, its over. Everything you've done amounted to that moment,
and you no longer have the free will. You legacy may or maynot continue, but you no more have a say on anything. Imagine writing an exam, and in the final moments
you retrospect what you've written. But ig the exam of life is kinda different. There is no prep. you just start writing the exam.
You are given a booklet like everyone else, but the contents are not the same. And there are going to be a few who will come to guide you.
But you got to make the decisions, and that shapes your booklet as well. The booklet is dynamic. And once you are written your decision you cannot take it back.

The booklet is going to come to an end. and they you will get one final moment to look at what you've written. And the most important thing is
to feel satisfied of what you've written there. And feel proud. Is it something that you would show someone ?

Also remember that you dont have to look at someone else's answer and feel bad you didnt write good enough. Well, the booklet is different.

Make sure you enjoy what you write, and you write what you enjoy to read.
