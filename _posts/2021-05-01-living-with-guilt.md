title: Living with guilt.

So the past 24 hours I've been restless over something I said to someone, and the guilt has been weighing me down.
When you know you have done something terribly wrong and there is no way you could take it back, how do you go on ?
I know a person who had caused a motorcycle accident where the other party died. How do you ever come out of that ?
you'll have it on you for the rest of your life, every night wishing you could take that one moment back. 
Even if the other party forgives you can you really forgive yourself ?

I guess some guilts dissapear with time, but some stay with you till the day you breath your last breath
wishing you had done that one thing differently. Life choices are hard to make, and many a times hard to even recollect why you even made that choice.
I dont really have a solution for this one, time can help, and if you're the best risk analyst out there who can avoid any such situation, but nothing is guarenteed.
So there is going to be times when you will feel the shittiest for having worsened the life of another, but you will have to learn to forgive yourself. IG ...
